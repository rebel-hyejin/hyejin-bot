"""System-prompt assembly for the `pr_review` handler.

Split out of `pr_review.py` so prompt-engineering changes live in a small
file with no business logic. The directive below pins the JSON schema, the
sign-off marker, and the inline-vs-summary split that downstream code
(`_append_folded_bullets`, `_filter_anchors`) depends on.
